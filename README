<h1>Push Swap</h1>

<h2>Push Swap is a sorting algorithm implementation that aims to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. It was developed as a project for the 42 coding school.</h2>

## Introduction

Push Swap is a sorting algorithm that operates on two stacks, named Stack A and Stack B. The goal is to sort the integers in Stack A in ascending order using a limited set of operations, which include swapping, pushing, and rotating elements between the stacks.

## Usage

Once you have compiled the program, you can use it to sort a stack of integers. Here's how you can run Push Swap:
