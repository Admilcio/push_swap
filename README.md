# Push Swap

## Push Swap is a sorting algorithm implementation that aims to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. It was developed as a project for the 42 coding school. The goal is to sort the integers in Stack A in ascending order using a limited set of operations, which include swapping, pushing, and rotating elements between the stacks.
